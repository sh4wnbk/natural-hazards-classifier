## What is a Landslide?

![Landslide Animation 1](assets/giphy.gif)

A landslide occurs when masses of rock, debris, or earth move down a slope. It is a type of "mass wasting," referring to the downward movement of soil and rock due to gravity. Landslides are categorized into five movement types: falls, topples, slides, spreads, and flows, which can involve different geological materials such as bedrock, debris, or soil. Common examples include debris flows (often called mudslides) and rockfalls.


## Why Study Landslides?

Landslides are a significant geological hazard affecting nearly every state in the United States. As populations expand into hilly or mountainous areas, understanding the risks posed by landslide hazards becomes crucial. It enables cities, towns, and counties to plan land use and design new construction and infrastructure to minimize the impact and reduce costs associated with living in landslide-prone areas.

While many physical causes of landslides cannot be eliminated, proper geologic investigations, sound engineering practices, and enforcing land-use management regulations can help mitigate these risks. Studying landslides also provides valuable insights into their causes, movement patterns, soil characteristics, associated geology, and the locations most susceptible to these events.

# Landslide Risk Prediction using Logistic Regression

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a logistic regression classifier 
for predicting landslide risks using historical environmental data and real-time inputs. 
The model incorporates critical features such as rainfall levels, soil 
moisture, slope gradients, and seismic activity to 
classify areas into low-risk or high-risk zones. 

By leveraging API-fed real-time environmental 
data, the classifier adapts dynamically, 
enabling semi-real-time predictions for disaster 
preparedness and risk assessment.

## Goals
1. Build a logistic regression classifier to predict landslide risks.
2. Integrate real-time environmental data using APIs from sources like NASA GPM and USGS.
3. Develop a dashboard for visualizing predictions and environmental conditions.
4. Provide an open-source framework for landslide risk forecasting.

## Project Features

### Historical Data Integration
- Utilizes static datasets (e.g., landslide occurrences, terrain features) for model training.
- Features include rainfall intensity, soil saturation, slope gradient, and seismic activity.

### Real-Time API Integration

- Fetches live environmental data from APIs:
  - **NASA GPM:** Precipitation data.
  - **USGS:** Seismic activity updates.
  - **NOAA:** Wind-driven rainfall metrics.

### Logistic Regression Classifier
- A machine learning model trained to classify landslide risk.
- Includes dynamic threshold tuning based on real-time updates.

### Interactive Dashboard
- Visualizes live landslide predictions.
- Displays real-time rainfall and hazard indicators for specific regions.
