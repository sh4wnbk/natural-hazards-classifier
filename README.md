# Landslide Risk Prediction using Logistic Regression

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a logistic regression classifier 
for predicting landslide risks using historical environmental data and real-time inputs. 
The model incorporates critical features such as rainfall levels, soil 
moisture, slope gradients, and seismic activity to 
classify areas into low-risk or high-risk zones. 

By leveraging API-fed real-time environmental 
data, the classifier adapts dynamically, 
enabling semi-real-time predictions for disaster 
preparedness and risk assessment.

## Goals
1. Build a logistic regression classifier to predict landslide risks.
2. Integrate real-time environmental data using APIs from sources like NASA GPM and USGS.
3. Develop a dashboard for visualizing predictions and environmental conditions.
4. Provide an open-source framework for landslide risk forecasting.

## Project Features

### Historical Data Integration
- Utilizes static datasets (e.g., landslide occurrences, terrain features) for model training.
- Features include rainfall intensity, soil saturation, slope gradient, and seismic activity.

### Real-Time API Integration
- Fetches live environmental data from APIs:
  - **NASA GPM:** Precipitation data.
  - **USGS:** Seismic activity updates.
  - **NOAA:** Wind-driven rainfall metrics.

### Logistic Regression Classifier
- A machine learning model trained to classify landslide risk.
- Includes dynamic threshold tuning based on real-time updates.

### Interactive Dashboard
- Visualizes live landslide predictions.
- Displays real-time rainfall and hazard indicators for specific regions.
